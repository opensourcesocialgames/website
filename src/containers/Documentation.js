          <p>
            The Open Source mindset is one in which the developers believe
            that communal coding is better than programming done for monetization.
            The software produced by Open Source projects is avaliable at no cost
            to anyone who has interest. 

            Anyone is able to take the source code of an Open Source project modify,
            enhance, or completely its purpose! Subscribers to the Open Source mentality
            believe that is allows for more creative and diverse end products!

            That being said there are ~some~ rules when it comes to Open Source. This is 
            where liscensing comes into play. Different liscences effect the bounds of what
            can be done with the source code in the future!

            It is a strongly typed language that builds on JavaScript which makes it better at scaling. 
            In addition Typescript has allowed us to catch errors early on in the development
            process, which saves us time in the debugging process!

            as well as easy to use. Material UI has aided us in styling most if not all aspects of our front-ends. The resource
            provided myriad templates for all components. The App Bar, Box, Paper, Tabs, and Tab Panel on this page were
            styled with Material UI! Our super fun and awesome game was also styled with components from Material UI.
